This is a simple example of how to use Pyglet to create a "twin-stick shooter" -style game.

You move the blue human with the arrow keys, and fire bullets with the `WASD` key cluster.

A simple space partitioning algorithm is used to detect collisions between all of the enemies and each other, as well as yourself. This way hundreds of enemies can be on screen at once with relatively little performance impact.

This example will continue to be updated over time, but you are free to use it as a basis for your own games.
